"many bugs with tagging and loading resources as well as a handful of UI "
"problems. It also makes our resource system faster and leaner. Because we "

"Gradients are an excellent way to quickly setup the main color swatches of "

"dithering for gradients](https://docs.krita.org/en/reference_manual/tools/"
"gradient_draw.html) in 8 bit images, which involves using a blue noise "
"pattern to create a little bit of offset in the boundary between colors. "

"(irc: tiar) Hired initially to fix bugs, Agata has been the second driving "
"force behind the resource rewrite. Many elements of the tagging and resource "
"UX has been tested to death by her, as well as handling all the bundles and "
"other resource libraries, such as ASL and ABR. She also worked on improving "
"the selection tools, the fill tool and improving the UX of the assistant "
