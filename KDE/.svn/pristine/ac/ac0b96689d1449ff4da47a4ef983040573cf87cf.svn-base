"Our window manager, KWin, has once again received significant updates, "
"moving away from legacy technology and incorporating the 'XCB' communication "
"protocol. This results in smoother, faster window management. Support for "
"OpenGL 3.1 and OpenGL ES 3.0 has been introduced as well. This release also "
"incorporates first experimental support for the X11 successor Wayland. This "
"allows to use KWin with X11 on top of a Wayland stack. For more information "
"on how to use this experimental mode see <a href='http://blog.martin-"
"graesslin.com/blog/2013/06/starting-a-full-kde-plasma-session-in-"

"improvements, now sporting configuration UI support, new animations and "
"graphical effects and many smaller improvements. This release brings better "
"multi-screen awareness (including an edge glow option for 'hot corners'), "
"improved quick tiling (with configurable tiling areas) and the usual slew of "

"[25 years](https://25years.kde.org) ago today, Matthias Ettrich [sent an "
"email](https://groups.google.com/g/de.comp.os.linux.misc/c/SDbiV3Iat_s/m/"
"zv_D_2ctS8sJ) to the de.comp.os.linux.misc newsgroup explaining a project he "
"was working on. The latest and direct result of that email (plus a quarter "
"of a century of relentless experimentation, development and innovation) has "
"just landed in KDE's repositories."

"This time around, Plasma renews its looks and, not only do you get a new "
"wallpaper, but also a gust of fresh air from an updated theme: _Breeze - "
"Blue Ocean_. The new Breeze theme makes KDE apps and tools not only more "
"attractive, but also easier to use both on the desktop and your phone and "
"tablet."

"Of course, looks are not the only you can expect from Plasma 25AE: extra "

"Apart from the new wallpaper, the first thing you will notice is the new "
"theme. _Breeze — Blue Ocean_ improves the look of Plasma and also makes "
"clearer what they are for. Active elements in a dialog window, for example, "
"\"light up\" when the window gets focus, checkboxes show actual ticks and "
"radio buttons switch on like bulbs. Scrollbars and spinboxes are bigger, "
"making them more accessible and easier to use with touchscreens, but have "
"been re-designed in such a way as to still look elegant on desktop and "
"laptop machines."

"Among other things, a few more details serve to add glossiness and style to "
"the desktop. For example, when starting an app or waiting for a process to "
"complete, you will see a spinning gear until the task finishes; and desktop "

"move them close to the panel."

"Subtle details like these, not only enhance the look of the desktop, but "

"... And, as long as we are talking about Plasma's new look, we must talk "
"about the new stuff in _System Settings_. Under _Global Theme_ > _Colors_ "
"you'll find a new option that lets you pick the desktops _accent colors_. "
"_Accent colors_ are the colors of highlighted items on drop-down menus and "
"lists, backgrounds of the icons of selected apps in the panel, the actual "
"bars in progress bars, the backgrounds of checkboxes and radio buttons, and "
"so on."

"Now say that, instead of the cool blue of Plasma's default color scheme, you "
"are feeling fabulous and want a hot pink for all those things: that is "
"actually the first choice in the list. Or maybe you want like a certain "
"chameleon-based distro and an intense green is your thing? You can do that "
"too. To make sure your colors match those of the overall theme, just click "

"Talking of walking stuff back, changing the monitor resolution can lead to "
"an unusable desktop. That's why now you get a countdown: under _System "
"Settings_ > _Display and Monitor_ > _Display Configuration_ , once you pick "
"a resolution and press the _Apply_ button, a dialog window with the "
"countdown will pop up. If after 30 seconds you haven't clicked the _Keep_ "
"button (say, because your desktop has become inaccessible) the system will "
"revert to the original, safe resolution. And this is just one of the ways of "
"protecting you against accidental configuration mishaps."

"Because keeping your system operational and safe is one of our main "
"concerns. That is why we always advise you when you are going to share data "
"you may not be aware of. Take, for example, _Night Color_: one of the things "
"you can do is use geolocation to synchronize the color temperature of your "
"screen with the periods of day and night of where you live. The _Night "
"Color_ page in your _System Settings_ will tell you when sharing your "
"location with a third party's service that provides the times of sunrise and "
"sundown in your area, and will also tell you who said the third party is. "
"Likewise, the _Feedback_ page now will show you a history of data that you "
"have chosen to send to KDE. Note that _Feedback_ will always be set to _off_ "
"by default. You have to explicitly and consciously switch it on before any "
"data leaves your machine."

"Of course, once you are done configuring, you will actually want to reach "
"your apps. You can do that through _Kickoff_, the application launcher that, "
"in a default Plasma layout, lives in the bottom left-hand corner of your "
"screen. Kickoff was already given a massive overhaul a few versions ago, but "
"again we have rewritten large parts of the code to make it faster and easier "
"to use."
msgstr ""

#: content/announcements/plasma/5/5.23.0.md:74

"And we added new options, of course. For example, now you can make Kickoff "
"stay open on the screen with the new pin button located in the upper right-"

"You will find the _System Tray_, on a default Plasma desktop layout, on the "
"right-hand side of the bottom panel bar. The _System Tray_ is important "
"because it contains things you would typically want to keep an eye on, like "
"notifications, the sound volume, the network status, etc. As the _System "
"Tray_ is a vital and (literally) iconic part of the Plasma desktop for many "
"users, care has been taken to improve its usability and that of the widgets "
"it contains."

"One widget you can access is the _Clipboard_, the place stuff you copy goes "
"and where applications get the things when you paste them somewhere else. "
"The _Clipboard_ has been improved in several ways, for example, it now "
"remembers 20 items by default and ignores selections that you did not "
"explicitly copy. This gives you more to pick from when copying, while at the "
"same time decluttering the list by removing snippets you may have "
"accidentally or absentmindedly highlighted while working with Plasma. To "
"further help you keep things tidy, you can also remove selected items from "
"the clipboard's popup by pressing the [Delete] key on the keyboard. Talking "
"of copying and pasting, you can now easily copy text from notifications with "
"the <kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>C</kbd> keyboard shortcut."

"A new thing in the _Audio Volume_ applet is that it now distinguishes "
"between applications that are currently playing or recording audio and the "
"_Media Player_ widget always displays the album art and its blurred "

"easy way to switch power profiles from the _Battery and Brightness_ widget. "

"Plasma on Wayland has come a long way in the past months. While our long "
"term support promise does not apply to the fast-evolving Wayland stack, we "

"minor glitches and missing features, but we are now at a point where we can "

"aksaklıklar ve eksik özellikler olacak; ancak artık sizden denemenizi ve "
